        <p>
            The purpose of this lab is to give students an experience of building and publishing a website. 
            It's also a review for students who have used HTML and CSS before, such as me. I learned HTML 
            and CSS in high school and made a website. I also made an unpublished website with a friend in
            my freshmen year of college. Even though I have the experience, I don't use CSS often enough to 
            master it. Other than HTML and CSS, I also learned JavaScript in high school, but I barely use 
            it. I can code in JavaScript but will be confused when I try to use it with HTML and CSS.
        </p>
        <p>
            For this lab, I use multiple CSS techniques to style the webiste. One of them is using the
            background-image property to add a background image for the heading and adjusting the image with
            background-repeat and background-size properpties. Other techniques include using the position 
            and float properties to position header, content, footer, and images. I also use margin and 
            padding to space out the content and elements.
        </p>
        <h3>Reflection on this assignment:</h3>
        <p>
            I like the amount of freedom that we have to design the website, and I get to play around with
            the position property. However, I don't like the requirement of using the float property. It's
            confusing when you use a mix of position property and float property.
