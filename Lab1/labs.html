        <h2>Lab 1</h2>
        <p>
            The purpose of this lab is to create this website so that students can have an experience of 
            building and publishing a website. It's also a review for students who have used HTML and CSS 
            before, such as me. I learned HTML and CSS and made a website in high school. I also made an 
            unpublished website with a friend in my freshmen year of college. Even though I have the 
            experience, I don't use CSS often enough to master it. Other than HTML and CSS, I also learned 
            JavaScript in high school, but I barely use it. I can code in JavaScript but will be confused 
            when I try to use it with HTML and CSS.
        </p>
        <p>
            For this lab, I use multiple CSS techniques to style the webiste. One of them is using the
            background-image property to add a background image for the heading and adjusting the image with
            background-repeat and background-size properpties. Other techniques include using the position
            and float properties to position header, content, footer, and images. I also use margin and
            padding to space out the content and elements.
        </p>
        <h3>Reflection on this assignment:</h3>
        <p>
            I like the amount of freedom that we have to design the website, and I get to play around with
            the position property. However, I don't like the requirement of using the float property. It's
            confusing when you use a mix of position property and float property.
        </p>

        <h2>Lab 2</h2>
        <p>
            Lab 2 has 2 parts. Part 1 is making a new responsive website, and the theme of the website is 
            our choice, so I made a My Little Pony (MLP) website. 
            <a href="https://cis-iis2.temple.edu/Fall2022/CIS3344_tun48961/lab2/index.html">Here</a> is the link to the MLP website.
            Part 2 is redesigning this website (from lab 1) to make it 
            responsive. For this lab, it took me less time to finish than lab 1, and I believe it's 
            because I understand CSS better now, especially floating, so I redo the floating part for my cat 
            pictures (and texts) on the about page of this website based on the floating that I did on MLP 
            website. The code is so much easier and better, but the overall look is the same. One thing that I like about this lab 
            is that I can make things look nice for small screens and the photo gallery. What I don't like 
            about this lab is that I'm required to put the form (survey) in a table because I think it's weird.
